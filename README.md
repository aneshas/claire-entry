# Claire Entry Project
Entry test project for Claire.nl

# Usage
Clone this repo, and run `./up` from the folder, which will pull all of the docker images, run containers, pull the code from github and build and run the app.

The app is available at localhost/api, or if you are running boot2docker on a mac you will need to get your boo2docker ip using `boot2docker ip`

To learn about the provided api endpoints, visit the api repo [here](https://github.com/aneshas/claire-go-backend)

To stop the app and the containers run `./down`
